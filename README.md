# spooky-name-generator

A quick and customizable name generator for characters in a spooky or otherwise mysterious settings.
Made this for generating NPC names for D&D campaigns on the fly, but it's been useful to others too so adding to github! 
Generates first and last names.

==============

To run downloaded code, open the command terminal and run `name_generator.py`
It'll prompt you for a number and optionally m or f for masculine or feminine names (separated by a space)

You can edit the text file `forgenerator.txt` if you'd like to add your own names! Just be sure to follow the formatting

At some point planning on adding a UI for this thing to make it more accessible. Happy generating :^]
